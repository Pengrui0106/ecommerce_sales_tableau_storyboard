💡 Key Insights
Generally, our company's sales and profits have been on a positive trajectory. 
CA and NY host most of our buyers. However, we are losing money in some states such as TX, OH, PA and IL.
NYC, LA, Seattle and SF are top profitable cities. Chicago, Denver, Phoenix and Texas cities perform badly. Discount always means losing money. 
Fast shipping is strongly related to customer satisfaction. We still need to improve logistcs and warehouse operations.
Discount gives us a larger amount of sales from 226.7 to 406.1 on average. However, everytime we receive a discounted order we may lose 11 dollars.
There is something really relied on discounts to sell, such as binders, appliances, tables and bookcases and machines. 
So what is the best discount rate? How to sell with a dignity price benefiting our customers as well as ourselves? From this graph, 25% is the watershed.
